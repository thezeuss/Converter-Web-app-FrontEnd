## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lesson to give a size to images, paragraphs etc. Because I didn't at first, so everytime I would upload my solutino to Frontend Mentor, it would look messed up.

I also learned that I need to add aria-labels to my social media icon links.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to size my elements better & stick to single CSS selectors.

### Useful resources

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - I used icons from here.
- [Font Awesome: Sizing Icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/styling/sizing-icons) - This helped understand how to size the icons.
